##### Copy Files

`cp -R` or `cp -r`: Both are recursive copy, meaning that cp copies the contents of directories, and their sub-directories as well.

Example:

Copy my dataset into p/project/kiste:
`scp -r ./patakchiyousefi1/00-DATASET/ patakchiyousefi1@juwels.fz-juelich.de:/p/project/kiste/patakchiyousefi1/`
